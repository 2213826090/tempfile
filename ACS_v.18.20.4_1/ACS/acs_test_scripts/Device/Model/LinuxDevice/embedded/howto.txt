HOW TO:

source files installation:
- ensure the installation folder exists on DUT
      mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
- copy (scp -r) all files and folders from acs_test_scripts/Device/LinuxDevice/embedded
  to /usr/local/bin/ on DUT


to register the command_server.py script as service:
- move command_server.service to /etc/systemd/system/
- run "systemctl daemon-reload"

to start the service
- run "systemctl start command_server"

to test the server in command line, try the client.py script under acs_test_scripts/Device/LinuxDevice/embedded
CAUTION: the SRV_IP variable need to be updated with real server IP address


you can start with a "python client.py help" command.
If everything worked fine, you should get a list of available commands
