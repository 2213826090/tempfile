    <!-- ACB Multi Device:
        This ACB board allow one PC to control several DUT where the original implementation allow one
        1 DUT to be controlled by several accessories.
        Only one DUT can be controlled at a time, meaning that you cant do simultaneous PC to DUT connection.

        1)Here declare the default usb/power supply to use.
        leave empty to declare that there is no mapping for usb/pwr button meanning
        that actions on this relay will be avoided.
        Use these fields when you control only 1 device during a campaign.

    <!-- 2)below command are for multi device used during 1 campaign
        put your phone name like "PHONE1" on the USB/power button value field at which it is mapped with.
        if your phone name is found then the default parameter above will be overridden by the USB/POWER_BUTTON values defined for this phone name.
        ACB have up to 4 usb ports, one next to another known and sorted as following [OTG][CDP][DCP][SDP] on normal ACB setup
        USB are counted from right to left starting by number 1 to match with normal ACB setup (SDP = USB_1)
        Here is how they are sorted and located:
        [USB_4][USB_3][USB_2][USB_1] *Right side of ACB where USBDIO black connector is located*
