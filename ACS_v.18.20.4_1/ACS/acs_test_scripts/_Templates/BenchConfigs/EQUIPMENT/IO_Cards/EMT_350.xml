            you CANT have 2 cards with the same No (No is equal to the slot position)
            the slot position are defined on emt350 documentation
            you CANT define which relay is affected to a DUT on a given CARD, they are all already mapped
            which mean that you CANT replace a broken relay by an unused one on the same card -->

                OUTPUT for this card are named "OUTPUT" + "_" + the port No
                each port can be affect to one DUT

                for multi device purpose (for parrallel execution) here are the restriction:
                - you cant use both OUTPUT at the same time which mean that an error will occur if one output is already used by another device
